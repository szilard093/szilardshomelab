Welcome to szilardshomelab repository! This repository contains the configurations and scripts I use to manage my personal homelab and a lot of guides. :)

In the first phase, I will show you how to install a Proxmox hypervisor, set it up, and then run a simple home server from an Ubuntu VM.

On the Ubuntu VM, we can install many self-hosted applications from an installer menu, such as Pi-hole, Traefik, Cloudflare Tunnel, qBittorrent, Plex, Jellyfin, Sonarr, Radarr, etc.

In the next phase, we will set up a Kubernetes cluster using Ansible.
